👨‍💻 **Cybersecurity Engineer in the Making**  
I help organizations secure their cloud and network edges using modern security platforms.  
My day revolves around **Palo Alto NGFW**, **Prisma SASE**, and **Netskope SASE** — ensuring users stay safe while staying connected.

⚙️ **Automation-Driven Mindset**  
I love reducing repetitive tasks and building smart workflows.  
Diving deeper into **AI-powered security automation**, SOAR tools, and detection engineering to make security faster, proactive, and scalable.

🎯 **Career Mission**  
To become a **Cloud Security / DevSecOps Engineer** who builds security into every stage of technology — from development to delivery.
