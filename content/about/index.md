👨‍💻 By Day: I'm deep in the world of cybersecurity consulting, securing digital landscapes and making sure the “bad guys” stay out (or maybe just learn a thing or two from them 👀

🌙 By Night: The real fun begins. You’ll find me hunting vulnerabilities on TryHackMe, cracking boxes like digital escape rooms, and scouting for bounties on HackerOne. I’m also on the path to the ultimate badge of honor: OSCP (aspiring certified hacker here! 🏴‍☠️)
