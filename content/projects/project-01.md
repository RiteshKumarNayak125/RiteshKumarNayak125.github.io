## Abstract

The **linux_network_security_tools** repository is a collection of essential scripts developed in Python to enhance network security for Linux systems. This toolkit includes various utilities, each with specific use cases:

- **ARP Spoofing** (`arp_spoof.py`): Manipulates ARP tables to intercept network traffic, allowing for analysis and potential vulnerability detection.
- **Password Cracking** (`linux_pass_cracker.py`): Implements methods to crack weak passwords and assess user account security.
- **MAC Address Changer** (`mac_changer.py`): Allows users to change their MAC address to maintain anonymity and prevent tracking on networks.
- **Network Scanner** (`network_scanner.py`): Scans the network to identify active devices and services, providing insights into network topology.
- **Packet Sniffer** (`packet_sniffer.py`): Captures and analyzes network packets to monitor traffic and detect suspicious activities.
- **TCP Scanner** (`tcp_scanner.py`): Scans for open TCP ports on target devices, aiding in vulnerability assessment.
- **Zip Scanner** (`zip_scanner.py`): Scans zip files for vulnerabilities and potential exploits.

These tools offer valuable insights into network vulnerabilities and empower users to strengthen their defenses. For more information and access to the scripts, visit the project repository: [GITHUB](https://github.com/RiteshKumarNayak125/linux_network_security_tools).
