## Python Remote Keylogger

### Overview
This Python-based remote keylogger is a powerful and versatile tool designed specifically for ethical hacking, security testing, and educational purposes. It serves as an invaluable resource for security professionals and researchers looking to understand keylogging techniques and assess system vulnerabilities. Beyond simply capturing keystrokes, this keylogger includes an array of features that enhance its functionality and effectiveness in various testing environments.

### Features

- **Keystroke Logging**: The core functionality of the keylogger is its ability to capture all keystrokes, including special keys like function keys, modifiers, and shortcuts. This data can provide critical insights into user behavior and system interactions.

- **Microphone Recording**: The tool can record audio through the system's microphone at specified intervals, allowing for the capture of ambient sounds and conversations. This feature is particularly useful for conducting thorough security assessments in targeted environments.

- **Email Integration**: To facilitate remote access to logs and recordings, the keylogger can automatically send captured data to a specified email address. This feature ensures that you can monitor activity without needing physical access to the target machine.

- **Cryptography**: The collected data is encrypted to ensure secure transmission and storage. Utilizing advanced encryption standards (AES), this feature protects sensitive information from unauthorized access and eavesdropping.

- **File Encryption and Decryption**: The keylogger includes functions to encrypt and decrypt files using AES encryption, enhancing the security of any sensitive files that need to be transmitted or stored.

- **Stealth Mode**: The keylogger operates silently in the background, minimizing system impact and ensuring that its presence remains undetected. This feature is crucial for ethical hacking scenarios where stealth is required.

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Designed to work seamlessly across multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux, this keylogger is adaptable for various testing environments, making it a versatile tool for security professionals.
